# Fake News Detection Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Fake News Detection Analysis** project focuses on identifying fake and real news articles using data analysis techniques. This project demonstrates **data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and pattern detection** to help detect misleading or fake content.

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled news articles with features including:

* `Title` – Headline of the news article
* `Text` – Full content of the news article
* `Label` – Classification: `FAKE` or `REAL`

## Key Features

* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and preprocessing text
* Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant textual features for analysis
* Text Analysis: Understanding patterns in fake vs real news
* Data Visualization: Statistical and graphical exploration of the dataset
* Insights: Highlights characteristics of fake news articles for better detection

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical computation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – (Optional for future ML-based detection)
* **Google Colab / VS Code** – Execution environment

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the dataset CSV file when prompted.
3. Run the notebook to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
